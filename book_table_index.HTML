          ['John Adams', 'David McCullough', 'Non Fiction', 'HBO show + 1776 (same author) inspired this read. Very good. Very interesting.'],
          ['A Man Without a Country', 'Kurt Vonnegut', 'Non-Fiction', 'Horrible. Very political, never funny.'],
          ['Rendezvous with Rama', 'Arthur C. Clarke', 'Sci Fi', 'Started on 3-27-16 and finished on 3-28-16. One of the best sci-fi books Ive ever read. By FAR Clarkes best work.'],

          ['SYNC', 'Steven Strogatz', 'Non-Fiction', 'Read in June, 16. Loved it. Obvious ties to neuro, also had cool stuff about astro and general history of field. Should look more into N.L.D and chaos stuff, particularly where it intersects with probability and graphs...Strogatz is a clear writer, althoug he does feel the need to remind reader of acedmic pedigree a bit too often I think.'],

          ['Neverness', 'David Zindell', 'Sci-Fi', 'Read in early september, 16. Very conflicted about this book. On the one hand, the ideas feel fresh and creative. On other hand, the writing at times is drawn out and mawkish. It could be that I took too long to read it. Will almost certainly be reading the sequels. '],

          ['On Intelligence', 'Jeff Hawkins', 'Non Fiction', 'Finished in late late May, 2017. Not many new ideas, just old ones repackaged--which is not neccesarily a bad thing. Definetly passionate and inspired. Would have been better if he had published actual scientific work, instead of just giving us a general verbal theory. Still enjoyed it, made me argue a lot.'],
          ['Diary of an Oxygen Thief', 'Anonymous', 'Fiction', 'Very funny. Almost like Apathy and Other Small Victories. Finished in early June, 2017.'],
