Dynamical systems are systems which evolve in time. When time is a continous quantity, this evolution is described by a differential equation. When time is a discrete quantity, this evolution is described by a difference equation. 

A differential equation looks like this:

$$ \dot{x} = f(x) $$

A difference equation looks like this:

$$ x_{t+1} = f(x_t) $$
