Everybody and their grandma grew up studying the continuous Lyapunov equation

$$\mathbf{M}\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{M} = -\mathbf{Q}$$


where $$\mathbf{M}$$ and $$\mathbf{Q}$$ are symmetric positive definite matrices, and $$\mathbf{A}$$ is some square matrix. This equation comes up when you look at the stability properties of continuous linear dynamical systems. Namely, those systems which are described by 

$$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$$

The reason this equation comes up is because when you take an invertible coordinate transform of the above equation $$\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{\Theta}\mathbf{x}$$ and look at the norm of $$\mathbf{z}$$ you find that
